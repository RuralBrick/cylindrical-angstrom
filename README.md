# High-T-Angstrom-Method
Use our code today and make Angstrom's method great again!

Installation:

pip install git+https://github.com/yuanyuansjtu/High-T-Angstrom-Method.git#egg=pyangstromHT

You can import the useful function:from pyangstromHT import high_T_angstrom_method.Then you can call functions high_T_angstrom_method.interpolate_light_source_characteristic so that this code can do stuff for you.

Just in case the repository is updated, please use this command to keep your local copy up to date:

pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/yuanyuansjtu/High-T-Angstrom-Method.git#egg=pyangstromHT


It can also be installed to use on colab:

!pip install git+https://github.com/yuanyuansjtu/High-T-Angstrom-Method.git#egg=pyangstromHT
