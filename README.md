# High-T-Angstrom-Method
Python code for analyzing infrared data using Angstrom's model. The author is lazy and doesn't put much documentations. The good news is it doesn't take much trouble to get the code to work, just read throught the error message and you can easily figure out how to make things right. Perhaps create one or two folders here and there, nothing beyond that.
